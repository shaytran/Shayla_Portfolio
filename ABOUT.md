I am a recent graduate from McGill University in Honours Anatomy and Cell Biology, passionate about healthcare and data analytics. I grew up in Penticton, BC, and am currently furthering my skills in the UBC Master of Data Science program, set to graduate in June.

My projects center around applying data science to uncover trends, with an emphasis in the healthcare field. With a foundation in R and Python, I aim to simplify complex data into clear insights for practical use. The core of my work lies in predicting future patterns and improving decision-making in diverse fields.
